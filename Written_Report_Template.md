# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise make an educated decision in regards to setting a reasonable campaign goal and selecting a good month to launch. This analysis will use historical data for other campaigns with emphasis on theatre ones. Insights derived by this analysis should lead Louise to a successful fundraising campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Methodology
I started my analysis by collecting the historical campaigns dataset into Excel. After which I started with the data clean-up process. This process included formatting columns using the correct data types, splitting the category column into "Parent Category" and "Subcategory", converting the Unix timestamps into readable dates, and more.

Secondly, I pivoted the data to be able to compare facts by certain dimensions. This allowed me to comapre campaign outcomes against different launch dates (months), and by different goals. Finally I created two charts to easily visualize the results.
